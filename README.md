### Micro Lending and Mortgage of Digital Assets

The current bank system do not provide low-duration high-interest Micro Loans to daily vendors because of unavailability of credit history and/or the inability of the customers to provide mortgage of the same value. We intend to solve this problem by providing micro loans to customers in form of fiat/crypto currencies by keeping their Digital Assets of the equal value as a mortgage.

### Definition of Digital Assets

NFTs, cryptos, holdings, stocks, bank accounts, intellectual property rights,
A digital asset is anything that is stored digitally and is uniquely identifiable that organizations can use to realize value. Examples of digital assets include documents, audio, videos, logos, slide presentations, spreadsheets and websites  

### SOLUTION

We intend to solve the problem of high micro-lending correspondence with respect to high interest rate and customer infidelity. We intend to keep various digital assets as mortgage for loan as many of the low yield households and other high frequency traders generally donâ€™t have cash to settle their transactions, however they can make the money in the long run easily and settle the transactions. Since lack of credibility by these individuals is missing. We propose the bigger picture and intend to bring them under the organised sector of lending instead of informal sector making the monetary overwatch easier.
